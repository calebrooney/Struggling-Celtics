# Struggling-Celtics

In the Joe Mazzulla Era, the Boston Celtics are arguably one of the greatest basketball teams of [all time](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/best-win-percentage-by-nba-coach).

However, from 12/19 to 1/27 they went on a bit of a slump (with 11 wins and 10 lossses in what is easily their worst 21 game stretch under Joe). Brian Scalabrine, former fan-fovorite Celtic and current NBC Boston Celtics analyst, thinks the Celtics struggles are due to them being [too good](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AKMWhU_1hek). Could this possibly be true??? Steve Kerr (coach of the all time great Warriors dynasty) says this is a normal blip, something that happens to all great teams. Other media rumblings seem to blame Derrick White and/or Jrue Holiday for being weak links. Let's see for ourselves.
